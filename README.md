# Parking Management System

This project manages a parking system with entrance, exit, and fire detection functionalities using FreeRTOS. It's programmed in C within the Arduino environment, ensuring real-time processing and task synchronization.

## Features
- Entrance and exit control: The system manages the entrance and exit of vehicles, ensuring orderly movement.
- Fire detection: A fire detection mechanism is integrated to ensure safety measures are in place.
- Ticket handling: The system generates tickets for vehicles entering the parking lot and manages their retrieval upon exit.
- Real-time updates: The number of available parking spaces is continuously updated and displayed.


## Usage
1. Connect the Arduino board to the required sensors and components.
2. Upload the provided code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Monitor the system behavior through the serial monitor or connected display.
